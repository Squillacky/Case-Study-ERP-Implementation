### 1. Business Context & The Problem

As a former CFO, I know that leadership needs clear, real-time insights to make strategic decisions. This project simulates a common business challenge: a global sales organization with data in disparate systems and no unified view of performance.

The key business questions to answer were:
-   What are our YTD revenue trends versus budget and prior year?
-   Which product line is driving the most margin?
-   Who are our top 10 performing sales representatives?
-   What is our sales pipeline conversion rate?

### 2. The Process & The Action

To solve this, I executed an end-to-end data analysis project. The process involved data sourcing, cleaning and transformation (ETL), and finally, visualization.

1.  **Data Sourcing:** The raw data was provided in three separate CSV files (Sales, Budget, and Rep Quotas), simulating data coming from a CRM and a financial planning system.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL):** I used Power Query within Power BI to perform all ETL tasks. This included:
    -   Standardizing date formats and data types.
    -   Joining the three tables on their respective keys.
    -   Creating calculated columns for key metrics like "Margin %" and "Variance to Budget."
3.  **Data Modeling:** I established a simple star schema within Power BI's data model to ensure efficient and accurate analysis.
4.  **Visualization:** I designed and built an interactive dashboard in Power BI, focusing on a clean, executive-friendly layout.

### 3. Tools & Technologies

-   **Power BI:** For all ETL and visualization.
-   **Power Query (M):** For data transformation steps.
-   **DAX:** For creating calculated measures and columns.
-   **Excel:** As the source for the raw CSV data.

### 4. Results & Key Insights

The final dashboard provides a single source of truth for the sales organization.

-   **Key Insight 1:** While the "Enterprise" product line drives the most revenue, the "SMB" line has a 15% higher profit margin. **Recommendation:** Investigate pricing strategy for Enterprise products.
-   **Key Insight 2:** The sales pipeline conversion rate drops significantly at the "Negotiation" stage. **Recommendation:** Provide additional training or resources to the sales team for this specific stage.
-   **Business Impact:** This dashboard empowers leadership to move from reactive to proactive decision-making, directly impacting sales strategy and profitability.

// This measure calculates the year-to-date revenue.
Revenue YTD = TOTALYTD(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), 'Calendar'[Date])
